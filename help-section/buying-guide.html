        <h1>Buying Guide</h1>
        <p>Need help choosing the right components for your PC build? Thats no problem! This guide breaks it down by component so you can make the best decisions based on your needs and budget.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>1. Choosing a CPU</h2>
            <p>Decide between Intel and AMD based on your budget and performance needs. While both AMD and Intel offer great CPU's, they both having confusing naming conventions. Don't just look at the higher number, look at the generation and always do extra research and compare.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>2. Picking the Right GPU</h2>
            <p>Gamers should prioritize GPU power. Consider NVIDIA RTX 4000 or 5000, and AMD RX series cards, rather than their old counter parts. Also in the modern age, VRAM matters. 8Gb is good for 1080p GPU's while at least 12GB is better for 1440p and 4K gaming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>3. Storage: SSD vs HDD</h2>
            <p>Use SSDs (preferably NVMe) for your OS and apps to ensure fast boot times and faster speeds when transferring files. At least 1TB of storage is recommended for most gamers as these days, PC games take a lot of space! Use larger HDDs for extra mass storage if needed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>4. RAM Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Always check your motherboard's memory specifications and choose a RAM that matches them. Check the manual if unsure. Also, consider the amount of RAM you need for your system. For older DDR4 RAM, 16GB is a good starting point, while DDR5 RAM requires at least 32GB for a smooth gaming experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h2>5. Case & Cooling</h2>
            <p>Make sure that the case has enough fans to cool your components properly. Also, make sure that the case fits your motherboard and most importantly, your GPU! Last thing you would want while building a PC is remove all the parts out of the case! For better graphics cards, water cooling is a great option than air fans</p>
